Leaving Earth Mission Planner

LEMP is an HTML page which makes it easier to plan missions for the boardgame Leaving Earth by doing all the math for you, as well as allowing you to easily make changes without having to erase anything or rewrite a whole page of maneuvers.

Updated 5/26/2022 to incorporate changes in Leaving Earth: Stations v2b.
